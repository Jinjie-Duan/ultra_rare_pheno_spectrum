This repository include the code and some of the results from the paper: http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/09/148247

The main code for the analysis is available as python notebook, called: ana_shared.ipynb. The file is getting updated to be more clear.

In `/annotations` you can find some of the annotations used in the study and in `/variants_lists` the final list of variants used.

At this point, we are not allowed to share individual-level data, but I will try to share as much as I can.

This repo is under active development, so if you need something that is not here please drop and email.
